          On March 14, 1879, ALBERT EINSTEIN was born in Ulm, Germany. In 1914,
          he was named Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in
          Berlin after receiving his schooling in Germany, Italy, and
          Switzerland and holding professorships in Bern, Zurich, and Prague. He
          started teaching in the fall of 1933 at the School of Mathematics at
          the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, became a citizen in the
          summer of 1936, and passed away there on April 18, 1955.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the age of 23, Albert graduated from college and was hired as a
          patent officer at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property in
          Bern, Switzerland. He earned his Ph.D. there while working, and then
          he was hired as a professor at the University of Zurich. He presented
          the mass-energy theory (E = mc2) during this time. His mass–energy
          equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has
          been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known
          for its influence on the philosophy of science
        </li>
        <li>
          On the basis of this idea, the atomic bombs dropped on Japan were
          created. Albert Einstein, however, opposed the atomic bomb launched on
          Japan throughout his life. After that, he presented a new theory of
          relativity, proving that Isaac Newton's earlier principles of
          relativity were false and that time and light are not constant. If
          moving at the speed of light, or about 300000 km/s, it will move
          slowly and a great deal of time has passed in modern physics.

          >Patent Office job: After graduating from college in 1902, Einstein
          had trouble securing a position in academia. He eventually managed to
          secure a position as a clerk at the Berne Swiss Patent Office. He had
          plenty of time with this job to reflect and investigate his scientific
          theories, which ultimately resulted in his contributions to
          physics.</span
        >

        <span class="exp-span"
          >Theory of relativity: While working at the Patent Office, Einstein
          created the theory of relativity, which completely changed how we
          think about space and time. This theory was the result of many years
          of research and contemplation, and it made Einstein one of the most
          significant scientists in history.</span
        >

        <span class="exp-span"
          >Emigration to the United States: To avoid Nazi persecution, Albert
          Einstein immigrated to the United States in 1933. In the Institute for
          Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he made his home and
          continued his scientific studies. He was able to continue his research
          and contribute significantly to physics and other subjects as a result
          of this change.</span
        >

        <span class="exp-span"
          >Nobel prize: Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for
          his contributions to the growth of the photoelectric effect and for
          his work in theoretical physics. This honour solidified his standing
          as one of the most significant scientists of his era and guaranteed
          his legacy.
